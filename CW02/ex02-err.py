The guessing game
It is a Python program that plays the number guessing game. The user thinks of a number within a given interval (e.g. [1, 100],
including both extremes of the interval), but does not input anything to the program; Program should ask questions to the user 
to know whether the number is less than, equal or greater than another number.
